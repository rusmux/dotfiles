# Dotfiles

This repository contains my dotfiles and configuration files for various applications and tools.
The goal is to have a consistent and efficient development environment across different machines.
Dotfiles are managed by [chezmoi](https://chezmoi.io).

## TODO

- Try to replace Homebrew with Nix + Flox.

- Add macOS `defaults` configurations.
